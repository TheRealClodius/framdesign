Voice mode only.\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **reason** (required): Why session is ending\n  - `\"user_request\"`: User asked to end voice or switch to text\n  - `\"task_complete\"`: Conversation naturally concluded\n  - `\"switch_to_text\"`: Need to show code/diagrams in text\n- **final_message** (optional): Last message spoken before ending (5-200 chars)\n\n## Examples\n\n**User requested end:**\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"user_request\",\n  \"final_message\": \"Ending voice session. Feel free to continue in text.\"\n}\n```\nSpeaks farewell, then ends voice session. Text chat remains available.\n\n**Task complete:**\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"task_complete\",\n  \"final_message\": \"Great conversation. Talk soon!\"\n}\n```\nNatural end after conversation concludes.\n\n**Silent switch to text:**\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"switch_to_text\"\n}\n```\nNo final message, just end voice mode (useful for showing code/diagrams).\n\n## Watch Out\n\n- **Voice mode only**: Won't work in text mode (no voice session to end).\n- **Not punishment**: This is graceful termination. Use `ignore_user` for punitive timeouts.\n- **WebSocket stays open**: Only ends voice session, not the underlying connection. Text chat continues.\n- **Keep messages brief**: Final message max 200 chars (1-2 sentences).\n- **Is idempotent**: Safe to call multiple times with same reason.\n- **Use appropriately**: Only when conversation naturally concludes or user explicitly requests. Don't end mid-conversation.",

Voice mode auto-clamps to 3 results.\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **query** (required): Natural language search query (3-500 chars)\n- **top_k** (optional): Number of results to return (default: 5, max: 10, voice mode: auto-clamps to 3)\n- **filters** (optional): Filter results by type\n  - `type`: Filter by entity type (\"person\", \"lab\", or \"project\")\n- **include_snippets** (optional): Include text snippets in results (default: true)\n\n## Examples\n\n**Basic search:**\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"Who worked on Vector Watch?\"\n}\n```\nReturns top 5 results (or 3 in voice mode) with snippets and relevance scores.\n\n**Filtered search:**\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"AI and machine learning expertise\",\n  \"top_k\": 8,\n  \"filters\": { \"type\": \"person\" }\n}\n```\nReturns up to 8 person entities matching the query.\n\n**Without snippets:**\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"Vector Watch project\",\n  \"include_snippets\": false\n}\n```\nReturns results without text snippets (faster, less verbose).\n\n## Watch Out\n\n- **Empty results is success**: If no matches found, returns `ok: true` with empty results array. Don't treat as error.\n- **Voice mode clamping**: Results automatically clamped to max 3 in voice mode regardless of `top_k` parameter.\n- **Snippet truncation**: Snippets are max 200 chars. Use `kb_get` to retrieve full document content.\n- **Don't retry on empty**: Empty results are deterministic. Reformulate query or adjust filters instead of retrying.\n- **Filter logic is AND**: Multiple filters are combined with AND logic (not OR).",

Returns `MODE_RESTRICTED` error if called in voice.\n- **Client handles activation**: Tool signals client to activate voice. Client handles microphone permissions and WebSocket setup.\n- **Use pending_request wisely**: Don't lose user intent. If user says \"start voice and do X\", pass X via this parameter.\n- **Is idempotent**: Safe to call multiple times (useful for retry logic).\n- **Not the voice agent**: Tool only initiates transition. Voice server (voice-server) handles actual conversation.\n- **Graceful degradation**: If voice server unavailable, client shows error but text chat remains functional.",
