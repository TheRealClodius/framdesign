## Overview

ClubAperitif is a membership-based lifestyle platform centered on curated dining and hospitality experiences. The brand positions itself as a community of like-minded individuals who collectively shape a "City of Flavors and Experiences" through their interactions with partner venues and each other.

The membership model emphasizes exclusivity, sensory discovery, and seamless digital-physical integration through a dedicated mobile application.

---

## What ClubAperitif does

ClubAperitif provides members with access to a curated network of restaurants, bars, coffee places, and event venues. The platform handles reservations, payments, and personalized service delivery while offering exclusive discounts and experiences.

Core services include table booking with privileged access, integrated payment processing, personalized service preferences (dietary needs, seating preferences), member-only events, and up to 30% discounts at partner locations.

---

## Brand philosophy

ClubAperitif frames membership as a journey through a metaphorical city created by its members. The brand emphasizes sensory engagement—taste, sound, smell, touch, and sight—as the foundation of meaningful experiences.

The membership admission process is designed to feel like receiving a gift rather than completing a transaction. New members receive a physical box containing a key object and a personal password, establishing a sense of ritual and belonging.

## The membership system

### The Gift

Becoming a member of Club Aperitif is and should be felt as a privilege. It should have a sense of mystique, a sense of romantic rendez-vous with an enchantress, so, it should come under the shape of an invite.

The invitation is not expected. It should come as a surprise, and usually surprises, like gifts, come wrapped.

The invitee receives a black envelope that has Club Aperitif's logo-mark inscribed in golden foil and embossed on one side, with the name of the invitee embossed in the same way on the other side. Other than this, the envelope is clean of other details, making you wonder of its content. This envelope in itself serves as a symbol. The one who receives it has been chosen to be part of something special.

Opening the envelope reveals an item with a special word written on it. This item may be a metal card, it may be something else, you never know.

### The Password

Each member receives a personal, non-transferable password that represents their individual identity within the community. The brand describes this as members collectively "writing the City" through their unique words.

### The Presence

What's the digital way of phrasing uniqueness? What's there unique about an app? What's there surprising about a confirmation or a code?

We all have a presence that overlaps with the digital and we've all seen how uniform this space has become.

If you look at the Club Aperitif app of another invitee, they're never the same, because we're never the same. We have structures that are similar but we come in all manners.

If you look at their confirmation codes, the ones the invitees use to make their presence known, they're never the same, they move and they twirl and they change depending on the hour and the day. This "badge" is unique to the invitee. It can be recognized by another Club Aperitif Partner app and works only on that phone and only for that person. It's digital, yet somehow physical. It's what invitation cards should feel like today.

What's near you? Where can you go? What's good for you? These are all questions with easy answers in the app.

### The Badge

The digital badge is a dynamic interface element that changes based on time of day and week. It uses geometric patterns and animated components to create a personalized, ever-shifting visual identity for each member.

## The Meet

We're walking out. We're going somewhere. Somewhere relaxing where we've invited someone.

Getting to know someone is about keeping things flowing and not be interrupted. There's no check, no tip-tow-ing around who's paying for tonight.

I am.

I've already payed, or am going to after, so I'll just walk up and leave when I'm done.

When you enter a Club Aperitif recommended establishment, you're greeted by someone. This someone is going to ask you for your unique badge. Remember, it's changing continuously because you've moved, it's night but it remembers important stuff, like what your allergies are.

Show your badge and you're all set. That "someone" just pointed their camera at your phone. They don't need anything else. They also have an app. The Club Aperitif Partner app. They can use it to place your order and you can always check if the order was placed correctly by checking on your app.

Leaving? The waiter was nice, she deserves a tip, don't you think? Tip in the app or better yet, just tip cash.

## The mobile application

The ClubAperitif app serves as both membership badge and service assistant. Key features include venue discovery and recommendations, table booking with instant confirmation, order placement and payment processing, service preference storage (allergies, dietary restrictions, smoking preference), bill splitting and tipping functionality, venue rating and history tracking, and real-time staff communication.

The app eliminates traditional friction points like requesting checks, payment discussions, or repeating personal preferences at each visit.

---

## Partner network

ClubAperitif maintains a curated portfolio of partner venues across multiple categories: restaurants, coffee places, casual eateries, cocktail bars, and event venues. The network extends beyond local markets to support members while traveling.

Partners receive member information relevant to service delivery (preferences, allergies) and provide exclusive benefits including discounts up to 30%, special packages, chef's table experiences, and exclusive tastings.

---

## Member benefits

### Curated venues

The platform emphasizes quality over quantity in venue selection. Venues are continuously reviewed and selected to match diverse moods and occasions.

### Streamlined booking

Members book tables without phone calls or back-and-forth communication. The system provides privileged access to high-demand venues and maintains complete visit history for future reference.

### Exclusive experiences

Members receive access to special events, chef interactions, exclusive dishes, and partner-only offers delivered through the app.

---

## Brand identity elements

### Visual symbol

The primary symbol is a door or portal motif, rendered in various states (open, closed, with oval/circular elements). This represents entry into the ClubAperitif community and the "City" members collectively create.

### The key

The physical key serves as the central brand object. It functions as both a membership artifact and a wearable accessory, carrying the member's unique password.

### Typography

The brand uses a typographic logo with a distinctive stylized "A" that appears underlined or accented, distinguishing it from standard letterforms.

### Color palette

Primary colors include warm gradient tones (orange to coral), black for contrast and elegance, and white for clarity. The badge interface uses dynamic gradient backgrounds that shift throughout the day.

---

## Service philosophy

ClubAperitif positions discretion and seamlessness as core values. The payment process is designed to be invisible—no checks requested, no payment discussions, no interruption to social engagement.

Staff at partner venues are briefed on member preferences before arrival, enabling personalized service without repetitive questions or explanations.

---

## Brand positioning

ClubAperitif distinguishes itself from conventional membership clubs by emphasizing community trust over transactional benefits. The brand describes itself as a community that designs the city through collective choices rather than a discount program.

The platform targets members who value curated experiences, minimal friction, and a sense of belonging to a discerning community.

---

## The Journey

We're all moving, and looking back, and viewing things fresh. We've been there, but now it's different. In tune, falling flat or picking it up as you go.

"Now" is not better, "now" is unique and that is the only quality we have.

You can take a plane and land in another country and still be able to enjoy Club Aperitif. Your presence will be known, your time well considered and you never ask for checks.
