## Overview

UiPath Clipboard AI is an intelligent automation tool that automates repetitive copy-paste operations between applications, documents, and systems by intelligently understanding, extracting, and mapping data. The tool comprehends content being copied and ensures it's placed in the correct fields of destination documents, eliminating manual format matching. Clipboard AI recognizes various data types including text, spreadsheets, invoices, receipts, and semi-structured documents, adapting its operations accordingly. It can extract data from scanned PDFs and handwritten documents, converting static text into actionable data. The tool is integrated with UiPath Autopilot, allowing AI-powered copy-paste operations from within the Autopilot chat interface.

## Context and problem

Manual copy-paste operations between different applications and systems are time-consuming, error-prone, and repetitive. Users often need to extract specific information from documents (invoices, receipts, forms) and transfer it to other systems (web applications, spreadsheets, databases), requiring careful format matching and manual data entry. Clipboard AI addresses these challenges by using AI to understand context, automatically detect document types, intelligently map data fields, and ensure accurate placement of information across different systems.

## Role and scope

Andrei worked on Clipboard AI as part of his role at UiPath, focusing on:

- **User interface design**: Creating intuitive interfaces for intelligent copy-paste operations, including context menus, toolbar widgets, and paste history management.
- **Visual design**: Developing the Clipboard AI mascot and brand identity, including logo explorations and visual language.
- **Interaction patterns**: Designing how users interact with Clipboard AI across different contexts—Windows context menus, floating toolbars, document processing, and form filling.
- **Workflow integration**: Mapping user journeys for common scenarios like expense reporting, invoice processing, and data extraction from various document types.
- **Autopilot integration**: Designing how Clipboard AI integrates with UiPath Autopilot for AI-powered copy-paste operations within conversational interfaces.

## What was built

- **Intelligent copy-paste**: AI-powered copy and paste operations that understand content context and automatically map data to correct fields in destination documents.
- **Document type detection**: Automatic recognition of data types including text, spreadsheets, invoices, receipts, and semi-structured documents.
- **Data extraction**: Capability to extract data from scanned PDFs, handwritten documents, and tabular data structures.
- **Persistent memory**: Clipboard AI remembers copied data for later use, maintaining a history of copied items with options to forget or save data.
- **Windows integration**: Native integration with Windows context menus, allowing "Copy with ClipboardAI" and "Paste with ClipboardAI" options directly from file explorer.
- **Floating toolbar**: Persistent global widget providing quick access to copy-paste operations with intelligent suggestions based on context.
- **Secure document handling**: Support for password-protected documents with secure data extraction capabilities.
- **Multilingual support**: Operations across multiple languages including English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.
- **Autopilot integration**: Seamless integration with UiPath Autopilot for AI-powered copy-paste operations within chat interfaces.

## Outcomes

Clipboard AI streamlines data extraction and transfer workflows, reducing manual effort and errors in repetitive copy-paste tasks. The tool automates data transfer between different applications and eliminates manual migration tasks, making it particularly valuable for enterprise users working with invoices, receipts, forms, and structured documents. Integration with Autopilot extends its capabilities into conversational AI interfaces, enabling users to perform intelligent copy-paste operations through natural language interactions.

## What this project represents

UiPath Clipboard AI represents FRAM's expertise in:

- Designing AI-powered productivity tools that enhance existing workflows rather than replacing them.
- Creating intuitive interfaces for complex AI capabilities, making intelligent automation accessible to non-technical users.
- Integrating automation tools seamlessly into operating systems and enterprise applications.
- Building visual identity and brand language for AI products that feel approachable and trustworthy.
- Designing for context-aware interactions that understand user intent and adapt accordingly.

This work demonstrates how AI can be embedded into everyday workflows to reduce friction and increase productivity, while maintaining user control and transparency.
