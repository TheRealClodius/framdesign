## Overview

Semantic Space is a canvas-based interaction environment where users interact with an AI agent that creates documents and images for moodboard creation and brainstorming. The agent has complete context of all assets in the space and can continuously remix and brainstorm within that context. Users can organize content in folders, view documents and images on a canvas, and interact with the agent through a chat interface to generate, modify, and iterate on creative assets.

## Context and problem

Traditional moodboarding and brainstorming tools require manual creation and organization of assets. Users need a way to quickly generate visual and textual content, iterate on ideas, and maintain context across multiple assets. Semantic Space addresses these challenges by providing an AI agent that understands the entire space's context, can generate documents and images on demand, and enables continuous remixing and brainstorming through conversational interaction.

## Role and scope

Andrei is working on Semantic Space as a lab project, focusing on:

- **Canvas interface**: Designing the infinite canvas workspace where users can organize images and document snapshots, with drag-and-drop interactions and spatial organization.
- **Mobile experience**: Creating mobile interfaces for viewing documents and folders, ensuring the canvas-based interaction works seamlessly on smaller screens.
- **Chat integration**: Designing chat interface patterns where users can interact with the agent directly from the canvas, with message bubbles supporting both text and image content.
- **Document system**: Creating document views that combine images and text, with inline editing capabilities and integration with the agent.
- **Folder organization**: Designing folder structures for organizing documents and assets within the semantic space.
- **Visual design**: Exploring visual language, color palettes, and interaction patterns for the creative workspace.

## What was built

- **Canvas workspace**: Infinite canvas where users can arrange images and document snapshots spatially, with support for overlapping cards and visual organization.
- **AI agent integration**: Conversational agent that understands all assets in the space and can generate new documents and images based on context.
- **Document system**: Rich documents that combine images and text blocks, with inline editing, highlighting, and formatting tools.
- **Folder organization**: Folder-based organization system for grouping related documents and assets.
- **Mobile interfaces**: Responsive mobile views for documents and folders, maintaining the canvas interaction model on smaller screens.
- **Chat interface**: Message bubbles supporting text and images, with contextual actions like "Reply", "Ask Agent", and "Make image" for interacting with the agent.
- **Remix capabilities**: Ability to continuously iterate and remix content, with the agent maintaining context across all modifications.

## Outcomes

Semantic Space demonstrates how AI agents can be integrated into creative workflows, enabling rapid ideation and iteration through conversational interaction. The canvas-based approach provides spatial organization while the agent maintains complete context, allowing for sophisticated remixing and brainstorming that builds on previous work in the space.

## What this project represents

Semantic Space represents FRAM's expertise in:

- Designing canvas-based interaction environments for creative work.
- Integrating AI agents into creative workflows with full context awareness.
- Creating mobile experiences that maintain desktop interaction patterns.
- Building conversational interfaces for creative tools.
- Enabling continuous iteration and remixing through agent-assisted workflows.

This work showcases how AI can enhance creative processes by providing intelligent assistance that understands context and enables rapid iteration, while maintaining user control and creative agency.
