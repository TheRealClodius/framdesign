## Overview

Fitbit is a consumer wearable platform focused on health, fitness, and everyday activity tracking. During this period, work centered on extending the Fitbit OS ecosystem through first- and second-party applications across multiple smartwatch devices.

The project involved designing scalable interaction patterns for small, constrained surfaces while supporting a growing ecosystem of apps and services.

---

## Context and problem

As Fitbit expanded beyond activity trackers into full-featured smartwatches, the platform needed a coherent application ecosystem that could support a wide range of use cases without compromising performance, battery life, or usability.

Design challenges included:
- Extremely constrained screen sizes
- Limited input methods
- Strict performance and power budgets
- The need for consistency across multiple devices and form factors

## Role and scope

Andrei worked as a **Product Designer** within Fitbit’s wearable platform team.

His responsibilities included:
- Leading UX design for second-party applications on Fitbit OS
- Managing and mentoring a small team of design contractors
- Defining interaction patterns and UI components reusable across apps
- Collaborating closely with engineering and product partners

---

## What was built

The work resulted in:
- UX design for 30 second-party applications across Fitbit Ionic, Versa, and Charge 3
- Launch of 18 applications as part of Fitbit OS’s first major update
- Core interaction patterns and UI foundations for wearable apps
- Designs for notable integrations including Nest, Strava, and Surfline

---

## Outcomes

- 18 applications shipped as part of Fitbit OS’s first update
- Each app generated approximately $200k in indirect revenue
- The work contributed to establishing Fitbit OS as a viable smartwatch platform
- Design foundations supported future device iterations and app expansion

## What this project represents

This project represents FRAM’s and Andrei’s experience designing **high-constraint, system-level experiences** where clarity, performance, and scalability matter more than visual excess.

It reflects an approach to wearable design that treats interaction as a system problem rather than a collection of isolated screens.
