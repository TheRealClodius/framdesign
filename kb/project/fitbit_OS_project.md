## Overview

Fitbit OS Apps was a design project focused on the second-party app ecosystem for Fitbit's smartwatch platform. Following Fitbit's acquisition of Vector Watch, Andrei Clodius led UX design for 30 second-party apps across Fitbit Ionic, Versa, and Charge 3 devices.

## Context and problem

After the acquisition of Vector Watch, Fitbit was expanding its smartwatch platform to include a richer ecosystem of partner apps. The challenge was to create consistent, high-quality wearable experiences across multiple device form factors while working with external partners and maintaining Fitbit's design standards for its new operating system.

## Role and scope

Andrei managed and mentored a team of three design contractors at Fitbit, leading UX for the second-party app program:

- **Team leadership**: Managed a team of three design contractors, providing mentorship and design direction.
- **UX design**: Led UX for 30 second-party apps across Fitbit Ionic, Versa, and Charge 3 devices.
- **App launches**: Shipped 18 apps for Fitbit OS's first major update.

## What was built

- **Wearable apps**: A suite of 30 second-party apps designed for Fitbit's smartwatch platform, including notable apps like Nest, Strava, and Surfline.
- **Design patterns**: Consistent UX patterns adapted for Fitbit's wearable interface across multiple device sizes.
- **Partner workflows**: Processes for collaborating with external partners to deliver high-quality wearable experiences.

## Outcomes

The 18 apps launched in Fitbit OS's first update each generated approximately $200k in indirect revenue. The project helped establish Fitbit's smartwatch platform as a viable ecosystem for third-party developers and partners, building on the wearables expertise developed at Vector Watch.

## What this project represents

The Fitbit OS Apps project demonstrates FRAM's expertise in:

- Scaling wearable design work across larger organizations and partner ecosystems.
- Leading and mentoring design teams to deliver consistent quality.
- Translating prior experience with constrained wearable interfaces to new platforms.
- Working with external partners to ship consumer-facing products.

This project represents the continuation of wearable design expertise from Vector Watch into a larger platform context.
