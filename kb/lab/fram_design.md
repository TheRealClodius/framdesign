## Overview

FRAM is a multidisciplinary design and product lab based in Europe. It works across software, systems, and digital experiences, treating software as a material rather than a purely technical artifact or design deliverable.

The studio operates with a small, senior team and focuses on work where design, engineering, and product thinking are tightly coupled.

---

## What FRAM does

FRAM creates, builds, and launches digital products across mobile and web platforms. In this capacity, it operates as a product studio, taking responsibility for both conceptual direction and execution.

In parallel, FRAM consults on the design of complex digital experiences, including work in wearables, smart environments, and agent-driven interactions.

---

## How FRAM works

FRAM approaches projects by treating software systems as designed environments rather than collections of features. This perspective emphasizes structure, behavior, and long-term coherence over short-term output.

Work is typically carried out by small, focused teams, allowing for close collaboration, fast feedback, and a high degree of ownership across disciplines.

## Areas of focus

FRAM’s work commonly involves:
- Mobile and web applications
- Design systems and shared foundations
- Embedded digital experiences
- Smart spaces and spatial interfaces
- **Agent-driven and AI-native interactions**

---

## Principles

FRAM values clarity of intent, craft in execution, and systems that can evolve without losing coherence. The studio favors work that benefits from long-term thinking and resists purely trend-driven approaches.

---

## Engagement modes

FRAM engages in two primary ways:
- **Product studio mode**, where it conceives, builds, and launches products end to end
- **Consulting mode**, where it supports teams in shaping and refining digital experiences, systems, and tooling

---

## What FRAM is not

FRAM is not a branding studio and does not offer services such as logo design, brand identity systems, brand books, or marketing landing pages.

The studio focuses on designing and building functional systems and products. Work that is primarily visual, promotional, or branding-led falls outside its scope.
